Use the same webapp from gitghub
	Implement JUnit or similar to automate testing 
	Implement Sonarqube to do static code analysis
		- use custom rules
	Maintain docker images - everything should work inside the image 
	Declarative code - pipeline as a code - and push to github
	Kubnernetes - deploy inside K8S
	Email notification on job failures in Jenkins
	Front end validations such as text is there or not, image is there or not etc. -- Using Selenium 
	Selenium tests should be integrated with Jenkins
	Monitoring - Use stackdriver in GCP, monitor Uptime, CPU, Disk space etc. 
	Deploy the whole application in K8N cluster 
	Success Criteria: 
		1. Jenkins pipeline code should work
		2. Docker image should work
		3. SS of various other things like Stackdriver etc..
